**How We Share Personal Data**

We will not sell your personal data to a third party or allow a third party to use personal data we provide for its own marketing purposes. We may share information about you with your consent, at your request, or as follows:

*To Our Service Providers.* We may use third party service providers to process your personal data to assist us in business and technical operations. DURT has data processing agreements with such service providers limiting their use of and access to personal data for specific purposes. They provide services relating, but not limited to fraud detection and prevention, billing, customer support, internet and connectivity, marketing, event organizing, security, and user experience.  
*To Infrastructure Processors.* We use third parties for some of the infrastructure used to host personal data we process, including cloud providers. DURT has data processing agreements with such service providers limiting their use of and access to personal data to specific purposes.  
*To Your Organization.* If you use DURT on behalf of an organization (e.g., your employer), that organization may (i) access information associated with your use of the Services including usage and other data (e.g., who has accessed, shared, amended, created, edited, or deleted content), and the contents of the communications and files associated with your account; (ii) control and administer your account, including controlling privacy-related settings (e.g., in-app profile settings including choices relating to displaying a profile image); and (iii) access and control of content.  
*As Custom Audiences.* We may share a coded version of your email address, name, city, state, or similar information with advertising partners to assist us in reaching you with more relevant advertisements outside of the Mobile Apps and Sites (and to measure the success of such campaigns); these partners are not permitted to retain, use, or disclose this information for their own third-party marketing purposes.
*To Resellers.* If you sign up for certain products or services (e.g., free trials) and you are located outside the United States, we may share your personal data with a DURT reseller so they can contact you about our products, services, and offers. We will disclose such sharing when you sign up for the applicable product or service, and will, where required by law, obtain your consent or allow you to opt-out from such sharing. If you purchase Services through a reseller (regardless of location), we may share certain information about your account and feature usage with the reseller (or their affiliate) in furtherance of their relationship with you. Resellers are independent data controllers of your personal data.

*In Transactions Involving Third Parties.* We may make services, software, and content provided by third-parties available for use on or through the Mobile Apps and Services; if you engage with a third party provider of such features, you will be notified or otherwise made aware of personal data being shared related to those transactions with that third-party.

**How We Protect Your Personal Data**

We have implemented technical, physical, and administrative safeguards to protect your personal data. However, no company, including DURT, can guarantee the absolute security of Internet communications.

**Blogs; Forums; Testimonials**

*Our Sites may contain publicly accessible blogs and interactive features.* Any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. With your consent, we may publish testimonials you share with us, which could contain personal data such as your full name and other information you choose to share.  
*Update or Remove Personal Information* If you wish to update or remove your testimonials, personal information or change any special information you have provided, please email DURT at [Support@didurememberto.com](Support@didurememberto.com).

**Linked Sites; Third Party Widgets; Your Organization**

*Links to Other Websites.* Our Sites may include links to other websites with privacy practices that may differ from ours. Any information you submit to a website not belonging to DURT is governed by that site’s privacy statement, not this one.

*Third Party Widgets.* Our Sites may include social media features and widgets, such as a ‘share this’ button or other interactive mini programs. Widgets can be used to provide you specific services from other companies, e.g., displaying the news, opinions, music, etc. Personal data such as your email address may be collected through widgets. Cookies may also be set by widgets to enable them to function properly. Widgets displayed on our Sites are not hosted by DURT and are subject to the privacy policies of the third-party company providing the widget, and not this notice.

*Your Organization.* When you use the Services on behalf of an organization, e.g., your employer, your use is administered and provisioned by your organization in accordance with its own policies regarding the use and protection of personal data. With respect to personal data contained in content, we are collecting and processing your personal data on behalf of your organization, who is the data controller. DURT is not responsible for the privacy or security practices of our customers. We may also share personal data with your organization about your use of the Services that may include technical details, e.g., metadata, relating to your content or usage of the Services. If you have questions about how your data is being accessed or used by your organization, please refer to your organization's privacy policy and direct your inquiries to your organization’s system administrator. Please note that if you lose access to your account, e.g., change of employment, you may lose access to content associated with that account.

**Integrations; Notifications; Linked Websites**

*Integrations.* Our Services may provide access via connectors and integrations (‘integrations’) to your third-party accounts such as Tableau, Slack, or Facebook. Integrations can be used to pull and/or push information from/to the Services, and to enable the applicable third party to receive notifications, such as sheet updates, from the Services. Any information you authorize to be transferred from the Services to an integration is governed by the third party’s privacy statement, not this one.  
*Sending Notifications.* Our Mobile Apps and Services may allow you to send notifications (e.g., update requests) to other individuals through email, SMS, and other third-party messaging platforms. Any information you authorize to be transferred from the Mobile Apps or Services is governed by the third party’s privacy statement, not this one.   
*Links to Other Websites.* Our Services include features which allow you to link to other websites with privacy practices that may differ from ours. Any information you submit to a website not belonging to DURT is governed by that site’s privacy statement, not this one.

**Mobile Application; Device Information**

*Mobile Application.* If you choose to download one of the Mobile Apps, e.g., atendit, we may receive additional personal data from your mobile device, in accordance with your preferences.  
*ADMATTS.* Our Mobile Apps use a unique approach to offering 3rd Party advertising impressions, URLs, and special offers to users.  This Advanced Data Mining Advertising Tag and Transaction system uses a custom algorithm that on your phone views Your Reminders, Notices and Alerts to determine what advertising tags might be of interest to You and then delivers that tag as an addendum to a Reminder, Notice or Alert that is issued based on your conditions as specified when you set up a Reminder, Notice or Alert.  These are not “push ads”, they are never pushed out separately.  
*Device Information.* The Mobile App may have access to your device’s camera or its geographic location, depending on the features you enable in the Mobile Apps and Services. Through your device settings, You have the ability to configure what functionality (e.g., your device’s camera or mobile location) the mobile app can access, and we will only access this information at your request. The mobile app may also gather information related to Your use of the Mobile Apps (e.g., device identification, login credentials, language, and time zone); device event information (e.g., crashes, system activity, and hardware settings); and information regarding your interaction with the Mobile Apps, which we may use to provide and improve the Mobile Apps. For additional information about your use of the Mobile Apps, see the  [End User License Agreement (EULA)](https://www.smartsheet.com/legal/mobile-eula). 

**Your Use of the Services**

In addition to Your rights described in this policy elsewhere, you can choose to Opt Out of using the Mobile Apps or related Services and You can set or change your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies.

**What is a Cookie?**

A cookie is a small text file that is placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners to make websites work (or work more efficiently) and to provide reporting information. Cookies can be session cookies or persistent cookies. A session cookie expires automatically when you close your browser; a persistent cookie will remain on your device until it expires, or you delete your cookies. Persistent cookies can be used to make tasks like logging into services easier for returning users by remembering a user's login information. Expiration dates are set in the cookies themselves; some may expire after a few minutes while others may expire after a few years. Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, DURT) are called ‘first party cookies’.  Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called ‘third party cookies’. Third party cookies enable third party features or functionality to be provided on or through a website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The company that sets third party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the company’s website and when it visits certain other websites. For more information on cookies, including how to see what cookies have been set on your device and how to manage and delete them, visit [www.allaboutcookies.org](www.allaboutcookies.org). 

**What are the Different Types of Cookies used by DURT?**

*Essential Cookies.* These are sometimes called ‘necessary,’ as without them we cannot provide many services that you need for the Sites and Services to function (e.g., essential cookies help remember your preferences as you move around the Services). Because these cookies are necessary to deliver the Sites and Services to you, you cannot refuse them. You can block or delete them by changing your browser settings, as described below under ‘Your Choices.’  
*Performance and Analytics Cookies.* These cookies may be set on your device when you visit the Sites to track information about how the Services and Sites are being used so we can make improvements and report on our performance. These cookies may collect information such as how visitors use the Sites, the number of visits to the Sites or Services, and how long a user stays on the Sites or Services. We might also use performance cookies to test new pages or notify you about new features to see how users react to them. Statistics cookies on the Sites may either be first party cookies or third party cookies.  
*Functional Cookies.* These are also sometimes called ‘preference’ cookies. During your visit to the Sites, cookies are used to enhance the performance of the Sites and to remember information you have entered or choices you have made (such as your language or region) but are non-essential to your use of the Sites.  
*Advertising Cookies.* These third party cookies are placed by third party advertising platforms or networks on our Sites in order to deliver ads and track ad performance, and to enable advertising networks to deliver ads that may be relevant to you based upon your activities, sometimes called ‘behavioral,’ ‘tracking,’ or ‘targeted’ advertising. 

**How Does DURT Use Cookies?**

To make our Services and Sites as user-friendly as possible, we – like many other companies – use cookies to uniquely identify you, to help us process your transactions and requests, to track aggregate and statistical information about user activity, and to display advertising on third-party sites. Specifically, on the Sites, we use these technologies to manage content, analyze trends, monitor page visits and content downloads, administer the Sites, track users’ movements around the Sites, and to gather statistics about our user base as a whole. In the Services, we only use necessary cookies for authentication and session management. These technologies may provide us with personal data, information about devices and networks you utilize to access our Sites and Services, and other information regarding your interactions with our Sites and Services. We may combine the information we receive from cookies with personal data we have otherwise collected.

*Third-Party Analytics.* We also use automated devices and applications to evaluate the use of our Sites and some of the Services. We use these tools to gather non-personal information about users to help us improve our Sites and user experiences. These analytics providers may use cookies and other technologies to perform their services and may combine the information they collect about You on our Sites with other information they have collected for their own purposes.   
*Behavioral Targeting and Remarketing.* We use advertising platforms, including but not limited to Google Ads/DoubleClick, Facebook Custom Audience, LinkedIn Marketing, and Microsoft/Bing to display ads as part of our advertising campaigns. As a result, our ads may be displayed to you on a search results page or on third party sites. Our advertising partners use cookies and other technologies such as web beacons to collect information about your activities on our Sites and other sites to provide you targeted advertising based upon your interests. The information collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other personally identifying details unless you choose to provide these. However, these third parties may collect your IP address or other device identifiers and combine the information they collect on our Sites with information about your visits to other sites to create market segments that they will use to more effectively advertise our services and those of other advertisers. Their tools may also limit the number of times you see the same advertisement and help measure the effectiveness of our advertising campaigns. 

**Other Tracking Technologies.**

Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website or an application.  We and our third party service providers may use other, similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear gifs"), which are tiny graphics with a unique identifier, similar in function to cookies. In contrast to cookies, these web beacons are embedded invisibly on web pages and are not stored on your hard drive. We might use web beacons to track the activities of Site visitors for targeted marketing, to help us manage content, and to compile statistics about usage. We and our third party service providers also might use clear GIFs in HTML emails to our customers to help us track email response rates, identify when our emails are viewed, and track whether our emails are forwarded. In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies will impair their functioning. 

**Updating this Privacy Policy**

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time in order to reflect operational, legal, or regulatory changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new notice on the Site and adjusting the “Last Updated” date. If you are a DURT customer and we make any material changes, we may notify you by email or by means of a notice through the Mobile Apps or Services prior to the change becoming effective. 
**Your choices**  
*Marketing Communications.* You can opt out of being contacted by us for marketing or promotional purposes by following the instructions in marketing emails we send.

**Your Rights**

You may have certain rights relating to your personal data under local data protection laws or based on your use of our Services. 

**Data retention**

We keep your personal data for as long as reasonably necessary for the purposes set out in our notices (see ‘How We Use Personal Data’). We’ll keep your personal data longer if required for tax or accounting purposes, to ensure we would be able to defend or raise a claim, or where we have a specific need - though we will generally not keep personal data for longer than seven years following the last date of communication with you. Where personal data is no longer required, we anonymize or dispose of it in a secure manner.
