Can I use atendit to remind me to bring my phone with me when I leave my apartment?  

Yes, with some limits.  You can set up an RNA to trigger whenever anyone goes through the door (Any Distance).  Your phone will produce the atendit ringtone as you start to leave.  So if it is in your pocket or purse, you're good to go, but if you hear it somewhere else you know you have forgotten to take it.  The limit is your range of hearing and the volume you have the ring set for.
