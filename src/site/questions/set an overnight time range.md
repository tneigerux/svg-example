Q. If I set an overnight time range, e.g., 11:00 PM to 7:00 AM, what happens if I also set a single day of the week, since this covers two days?  
Since all criteria need to be met before a reminder, notice, or alert (RNA) can be issued, you will only receive an RNA on that day of the week.   For Example, for a Tuesday only setting, the RNA will only be issued (if a trigger occurs) from midnight to 7:00 AM Tuesday and then from 11:00 PM to Midnight the same day. Consider setting multiple days to cover the overnight(s) you want or just set to all days (Default).
