If I delete my Sensor what happens to the RNA I have set up?  

The RNA is automatically made “Inactive” (grey slide switch).  You can make it active again by performing an Edit and selecting another Sensor.  If you relink the same Sensor using the original name, the RNA will not work until you Edit the details of the RNA and select that Sensor and then Save.
