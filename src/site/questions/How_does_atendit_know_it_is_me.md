How does atendit know it is me or someone else going through the door?  

(the Near vs Far app calculation). Atendit calculates the distance the phone is from the beacon, currently set for 2.5 meters, to determine if it is you at the door. If it sees you are further away when the Sensor is triggered the software assumes it is not you at the doorway. This helps when there are multiple users in the same household or office.
