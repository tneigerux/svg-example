comparisonsign: How is atendit different?
comparisontext: atendit, unlike any other reminder apps, reminds you as you open the door to leave your home, apartment or office.  Not based on clock time or outside GPS location as other reminders are, atendit reminds you “just in time”.  atendit uses a Sensor, a Bluetooth Low Energy Beacon, that detects movement and briefly transmits that the door has moved triggering the atendit app to immediately issues a Notification containing your reminder information.

## All smartphones have reminders, but atendit is different. Other reminder systems are limited to the calendar, clock, or GPS. The atendit system leverages our atendit sensor, which uses motion detection & bluetooth to remind, notify & alert you based on custom rules you tailor using the atendit app.
