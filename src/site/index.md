# Welcome

atendit is a new product that delivers **event** driven **conditional reminders, notices, and alerts.**

The atendit Sensor, which will be available on Amazon soon, attaches to any door in a home or business. 

Our customers then use our free atendit mobile app, in conjunction with the Sensor, to establish their own unique **conditional reminders, notices,** and **alerts.**

When you open the door (**event**) the Sensor is activated, the user’s **conditions** are checked. If there’s a match the **reminder, notice, or alert** is immediately displayed on your phone.

Communication between the Sensor, which is approximately the size of a U.S. quarter, and the Smartphone is via Bluetooth Low Energy technology.

Examples of a commercial and residential usage scenarios are shown below.
