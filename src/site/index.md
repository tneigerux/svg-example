# Welcome

atendit is a unique new product that delivers event driven conditional reminders, notices, and alerts.

The atendit Sensor, which will be available on Amazon soon, attaches to any door in a home or business. It’s approximately the size of a U.S. quarter.

Our customers then use our free atendit mobile app, in conjunction with the Sensor, to establish their own unique **conditional reminders, notices,** and **alerts.**

When the sensor is activated by the door opening (**event**), the user’s **conditions** are checked, and if there’s a match the **reminder** is displayed using the phone’s notification system.

Communication between the Sensor and the Smartphone is via Bluetooth LE (Low Energy).

Examples of a commercial and residential usage scenario are shown below.
