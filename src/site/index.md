# Welcome

atendit is a unique new product that delivers event driven conditional reminders, notices, and alerts.

The atendit Sensor, which will be available on Amazon soon, attaches to any door in a home or business. It’s approximately the size of the U.S. quarter.

Our customers then use our free atendit mobile app in conjunction with it, establishing their own unique CONDITIONAL REMINDERS.

When the sensor is activated by the door opening EVENT, the user’s CONDITIONS are checked against, and if there’s a match the REMINDER is displayed using the phone’s notification system.

Communication between the Sensor and the Smartphone is via Bluetooth LE (Low Energy).

Examples of a commercial and residential usage scenario are shown below.
